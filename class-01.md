## 1. Pain vs. Suffering
All growth comes with some degree of **pain**, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life.

Do not confuse this with suffering.

**Suffering** is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.


* **My Prespective:** I came to ASAC to _earn_ the skills that will help me build my value throughout the next phase of my life.
* **Why am I doing this:** To get a job and build a career in Software Engineering.
* **Do I want what comes at the end of this journey:** Yes, Can't wait!
* **Am I doing this for me? YES!


## 2. Intro to Big-O notation: 
The **Big O** notation defines an upper bound of an algorithm, it bounds a function only from above. 
For example, consider the case of Insertion Sort. It takes linear time in best case and quadratic time in worst case. 
The following are the some types of algorithms in terms of complexity, Where, n is the input size and c is a positive constant: 

* A logarithmic algorithm – `O(logn)` Runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to n.
* A linear algorithm – `O(n)`Runtime grows directly in proportion to n.
* A superlinear algorithm – `O(nlogn)` Runtime grows in proportion to n.
* A polynomial algorithm – `O(nc)` Runtime grows quicker than previous all based on n.
* A exponential algorithm – `O(cn)` Runtime grows even faster than polynomial algorithm based on n.
* A factorial algorithm – `O(n!)` Runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even
small values of n.

Some of the examples of all those types of algorithms (in worst-case scenarios) are mentioned below:

▪ Logarithmic algorithm – O(logn) – Binary Search.
▪ Linear algorithm – O(n) – Linear Search.
▪ Superlinear algorithm – O(nlogn) – Heap Sort, Merge Sort.
▪ Polynomial algorithm – O(n^c) – Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bucket Sort.
▪ Exponential algorithm – O(c^n) – Tower of Hanoi.
▪ Factorial algorithm – O(n!) – Determinant Expansion by Minors, Brute force Search algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem.
